# Titanic-Machine-Learning
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the survival outcomes of passengers on the Titanic. Using the well-known Titanic dataset from Kaggle, I explored data preprocessing, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), built and trained different machine learning models, and evaluated their performance.
